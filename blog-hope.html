      In the heart of underserved communities, access to education is still a daily struggle. Children walk for miles, lack basic supplies, or stay home due to family responsibilities. Grey Navies Foundation is changing that one step at a time.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2024, we launched an education initiative aimed at supporting over 300 children across rural districts. With the help of our partners and donors, we’ve distributed books, uniforms, and scholarships. We've also trained local educators to improve the quality of learning environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of our success stories is Amina, a 10-year-old girl who had dropped out of school to help her mother at the market. Through our program, Amina is now back in school, thriving, and dreaming of becoming a nurse.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our mission goes beyond enrollment. We create learning spaces that are safe, inclusive, and joyful. We believe that empowering a child through education builds stronger families, stronger communities, and a brighter future.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you to all our volunteers and supporters who make this possible. Your kindness writes the future.
